ARIETTA-EVE
===========

FTDI EVE application examples with an enhanced HAL using ARIETTA as target.

The ARIETTA G25 boards from ACME SYSTEMS (www.acmesystems.it) are based on ATMEL AT91SAM9G25 processors running Linux.
If you want to use them with the FTDI EVE processor FT800, you have to enhance the HAL to support the ARIETTA SPI port.

This source code implements a simple HAL so the orginal application examples can be used unmodified.
